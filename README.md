# ObjectDetection
# Task2: the last part of task2 is to run an example python code with OpenCV 

In this task I have used google colab to run an example of python code using openCV. This is an example of object detection, where we upload an image and run the program to detect the object in the image.

# To run the code:
1. You have to run each cell.
2. Mount your data from google drive to upload the images.
3. Run the rest of the cells.

# What is the difference between RGB and BGR?
Difference between RGB and BGR. Most often, an RGB color is stored in a structure or unsigned integer with Blue occupying the least significant “area” (a byte in 32-bit and 24-bit formats), Green the second least, and Red the third least. BGR is the same, except the order of areas is reversed

# Why does cv2 use BGR?
The reason the early developers at OpenCV chose BGR color format is that back then BGR color format was popular among camera manufacturers and software providers. E.g. in Windows, when specifying color value using COLORREF they use the BGR format 0x00bbggrr.
